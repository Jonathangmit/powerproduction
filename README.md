The file can be read simply by executing the cells downwards through the notebook. The notebook describes linear and non linear models using SKlearn and Numpy Polyfit. The final equation determined by the models is displayed with a comparison of the accuracies using the least squares method and a visualisation of the errors between 1st and 5th order models.

Thanks
